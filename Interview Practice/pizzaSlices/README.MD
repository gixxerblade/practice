# Cassidoo's Interview question of the week

## September 28, 2020

## This week’s question:

Given an array of people objects (where each person has a name and a number of pizza slices they’re hungry for) and a number for the number of slices that the pizza can be sliced into, return the number of pizzas you need to buy.

## Input

```javascript
const arr = [
  { name: "Joe", num: 9 },
  { name: "Cami", num: 3 },
  { name: "Cassidy", num: 4 },
];
```

## Output

```javascript
gimmePizza(arr, 8)
```

```bash
16 slices needed, pizzas can be sliced into 8 pieces, so 2 pizzas should be ordered
```
