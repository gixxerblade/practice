            Neil Armstrong—Neil Alden Armstrong (1930-2012) was born on 5 August
            1930 on his grandparents' farm near Wapakoneta, Ohio, to Stephen and
            Viola Armstrong. Because Armstrong's father was an auditor for the
            state of Ohio, Armstrong grew up in several communities, including
            Warren, Jefferson, Ravenna, St. Marys, and Upper Sandusky, before
            the family settled in Wapakoneta.

          <p>
            At age 15, Armstrong began taking flying lessons at an airport north
            of Wapakoneta, working at various jobs in town and at the airport to
            earn the money for lessons in an Aeronca Champion airplane. By age
            16, he had his student pilot's license—before he even passed his
            automobile driver's test and received that license and before he
            graduated from Blume High School in Wapakoneta in 1947.

            Immediately after high school, Armstong received a scholarship from
            the U.S. Navy. He enrolled at Purdue University and began his
            studies of aeronautical engineering. In 1949, the Navy called him to
            active duty, where he became an aviator, and in 1950, he was sent to
            Korea. There he flew 78 combat missions from the aircraft carrier
            USS Essex.

            In the mid-1950s, Armstrong transferred to NASA's Flight Research
            Center in Edwards, California, where he became a research pilot on
            many pioneering high-speed aircraft, including the well-known, 4,000
            mile-per-hour X-15. He flew over 200 different models of aircraft,
            including jets, rockets, helicopters, and gliders. While there, he
            also pursued graduate studies and received a master of science
            degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Southern
            California.

            On 16 March 1966, Armstrong flew his first space mission as command
            pilot of Gemini VIII with David Scott. During that mission,
            Armstrong piloted the Gemini VIII spacecraft to a successful docking
            with an Agena target spacecraft already in orbit. Although the
            docking went smoothly and the two craft orbited together, they began
            to pitch and roll wildly. Armstrong was able to undock the Gemini
            and used the retro rockets to regain control of his craft, but the
            astronauts had to make an emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean.

          <p>
            As spacecraft commander for Apollo 11, the first piloted lunar
            landing mission, Armstrong gained the distinction of being the first
            person to step onto the surface of the Moon. As commander of Apollo
            11, Armstrong piloted the Lunar Module to a safe landing on the
            Moon's surface. On 20 July 1969, at 10:56 p.m. EDT, Neil Armstrong
            stepped down onto the Moon and made his famous statement, "That's
            one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." On 24 July
            1969, the Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.

            After resigning from NASA in 1971, he became a professor of
            aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati and served
            from 1971 to 1979. During the years 1982 to 1992, Armstrong served
            as chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation, Inc., in
            Charlottesville, Virginia. He then became chairman of the board of
            AIL Systems, Inc., an electronics systems company is in Deer Park,
            New York. Neil Armstrong died in 2012.
