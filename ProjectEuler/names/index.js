/**
 * Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),

 * to obtain a name score.
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, 
 * COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. 
 * So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
